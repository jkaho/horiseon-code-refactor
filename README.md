## Motivations

The objective of this project was to adhere to best practices to increase accessibility of the web application and the readability of the source code without altering the appearance and intended functionality of the web application. 

The improved source code allows more people, regardless of personal limitations, to read the webpage’s content. This project contributes to web equality, in aiming to provide all people with access to the same online resources and information.  

Further, HTML elements were also modified to improve the web application’s visibility in search engine results, which is particularly important for a business such as Horiseon, which offers search engine optimization services.
